# MachineLearning - DataSet Quality Research

This page will contain our progress in creating a report detailing the quality of diferent data sets.

We have aquired permission from Mike Sconzo, owner of secrepo.com, to use his security datasets to analyze and report on the data. 


# Security Datasets for Machine Learning
by Tien Tran, Citlalin Galvan, Vivian Nguyen, Huy Nguyen

## WHY FOCUS ON DATASETS?
Machine Learning is on the rise ⇑

A Machine Learning Algorithm can: 
Detect Suspicious Activity  
Stop malicious files from executing

The Problem:
One critical problem in Machine Learning is the limited data for security and the quality of training datasets in Cyber Security. Without a good quality dataset, a Machine Learning Algorithm cannot learn properly.
